# Dutraserver
Dutraserver is my home server where I do a variety of things. The purpose of doing everything in Docker is for **portability**. I can run this server on any computer that has Docker Engine and Compose installed.

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/viniciusdutra314/dutraserver_backend.git
cd folder && docker compose up -d #(in each folder)

After that, you should enter each web UI and configure everything for your needs. All the necessary folders will be created automatically.
